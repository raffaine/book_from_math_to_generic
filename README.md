# Summary
This is my workspace to exercise and work along while reading the book "From Mathematics to Generic Programming" by Alexander A. Stepanov and Daniel E. Rose.

# Building and Running
This was tested and built in C++ with gcc 11.4.0 on an Ubuntu 22.04.4 running in Windows with WSL (2.5.10)
To build a particular chapter, run `make <chapter>` where `<chapter>` indicates the number of one of the existing chapters (listed with prefix `ch`, e.g. `make 7` to build the folder `ch7`) and you can run the produced binary with `./a.out`.
